# Web-Application-for-machine-learning

The aim of the project was originally to develop an application to give to users a simple interface to run various machine learning techniques. Users would upload a dataset of their interest and then would have easily select the columns (variables) on which to apply the algorithms (e.g. Random forest classifier, PCA, linear models). 
The final scope of my application is, however, more limited. In fact, the complexity of the project increased quicker than expected, affecting the completeness of the statistical analysis.


The uses of my application are: 

- Data exploration tools
-  Principal Component Analysis and Visualization
- Linear Discriminant Analysis for binary classification
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- (Still developing: Random Forest Classifier loaded with PCA output)

The project is developed in R, particularly with the Shiny package. The code can be found in the files server and ui with the extention .R.
